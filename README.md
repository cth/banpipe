This is a reimplementation of banpipe in Logtalk. 
Banpipe is a declarative pipeline with emphasis on large time consuming analysis for big data.

This implementation will superseed the previous implementation which was written 
for the PRISM language and which contains a lot of stuff which is particular to the LoSt project.
The previous implementation "banpipe-lost" is available from http://github.com/cth/banpipe_lost
