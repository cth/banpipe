This is an experimental reimplementation of banpipe in Logtalk. 
Banpipe is a declarative pipeline with emphasis on large time consuming analyses, e.g., for big data files.  

This implementation is meant to be smaller, portable and more usable in more general contexts.
For now, it serves as a "development branch" for the banpipe language. It will be compatible with
the language of the original banpipe implementation (banpipe-lost - available http://github.com/cth/banpipe_lost).

The banpipe-lost contains a lot of libraries and modules specific to biological sequences and is developed
exclusively for PRISM as host language. This software contains many components developed as part of the 
lost project (http://lost.ruc.dk).

The focus of this implementation, however, is only the banpipe language itself.
